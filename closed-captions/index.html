                <p class="Leon">What desert</p>
                <p class="Holden">Doesn't make any difference</p>
                <p class="Holden">What desert is completely hypothetical.</p>
                <p class="Leon">But how come I'd be there?</p>
                <p class="Holden">Maybe you're fed up.</p>
                <p class="Holden">Maybe you want to be by yourself who knows</p>
                <p class="Holden">You look down and you see a tortoise Leon</p>
                <p class="Holden">It's crawling towards you</p>
                <p class="Leon">Tortoise, what's that?</p>
<!--                <p class="Holden" class="soundEffect">Pfff</p>-->
                <p class="Holden">You know what a turtle is?</p>
                <p class="Leon">Of course.</p>
                <p class="Holden">Same thing.</p>
                <p class="Leon">I've never seen a turtle.</p>
                <p class="Leon">But I understand what you mean.</p>
                <p class="Holden">You reach down and you flip the tortoise</p>
                <p class="Holden">over on its back, Leon.</p>
                <p class="Leon">You make up these questions, Mr Holden?</p>
                <p class="Leon">Or do they write them down for you?</p>
                <p class="Holden">The tortoise lays on its back,</p>
                <p class="Holden">its belly baking in the hot sun,</p>
                <p class="Holden">beating its legs trying to turn itself over</p>
                <p class="Holden">but it can't, not without your help.</p>
                <p class="Holden">But you're not helping.</p>
                <p class="Leon">What do you mean I'm not helping?</p>
                <p class="Holden">I mean, you're not helping.</p>
                <p class="Holden">Why is that, Leon?</p>
                <p class="Holden">They're just questions, Leon.</p>
                <p class="Holden">In answer to your query,</p>
                <p class="Holden">they're written down for me.</p>
                <p class="Holden">It's a test</p>
                <p class="Holden">designed to provoke an emotional response</p>
                <p class="Holden">Shall we continue?</p>
                <p class="Holden">Describe in single words</p>
                <p class="Holden">only the good things</p>
                <p class="Holden">that come into you're mind</p>
                <p class="Holden">about your mother.</p>
                <p class="Leon">My mother?</p>
                <p class="Holden">Yeah</p>
