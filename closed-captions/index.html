        <p class="">If we're gonna play games...</p>
        <p class="">I'm gonna need a cup of coffee</p>
        <p class="">Aaaah... the "good cop/bad cop" routine?</p>
        <p class="">Not exactly</p>
        <p class="">Never start with the head</p>
        <p class="">The victim gets all... fuzzy</p>
        <p class="">You can't feel the next...</p>
        <p class="">See?</p>
        <p class="">You wanted me, here I am</p>
        <p class="">I wanted to see what you'd do</p>
        <p class="">And you didn't disappoint</p>
        <p class="">You let five people die</p>
        <p class="">Then, you let Dent take your place</p>
        <p class="">Even to a guy like me, that's cold</p>
        <p class="">Where's Dent?</p>
        <p class="">Those Mob fools want you gone so they can get back to the way things were</p>
        <p class="">But I know the truth</p>
        <p class="">There's no going back</p>
        <p class="">You've changed things... forever</p>
        <p class="">Then why do you wanna kill me?</p>
        <p class="">I don't-- I don't wanna kill you!</p>
        <p class="">What would I do without you?</p>
        <p class="">Go back to ripping off Mob dealers? No. No.</p>
        <p class="">No!</p>
        <p class="">No, you-- you complete me</p>
        <p class="">You're garbage, who kills for money</p>
        <p class="">Don't talk like one of them, you're not!</p>
        <p class="">Even if you'd like to be</p>
        <p class="">To them you're just a freak, like me!</p>
        <p class="">They need you right now</p>
        <p class="">But when they don't...</p>
        <p class="">They'll cast you out... like a leper!</p>
        <p class="">See, their morals, their "code"... it's a bad joke</p>
        <p class="">Dropped at the first sign of trouble</p>
        <p class="">They're only as good as the world allows them to be</p>
        <p class="">And I'll show you... when the chips are down</p>
        <p class="">these... these "civilized people"... they'll eat each other</p>
